# 🌬️ Portable Hand Fan — Fusion 360 Design

This project features a fully modeled **portable handheld fan**, inspired by a real product I received as a gift from my dad during a trip to Singapore. Reimagined with a modern touch, this design captures both aesthetic and ergonomic principles, built entirely from scratch in **Autodesk Fusion 360**.

## ✨ Inspiration

This fan design is based on a compact, functional fan that became a travel essential for me. I recreated it in Fusion 360 with slight personal design tweaks — focusing on clean geometry, functional button placement, and manufacturing-ready proportions.
